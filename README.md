# 5DXCC Framework
## Discovery, Development, Documentation, Debugging, Data analysis, eXploration Claude Code Framework

### TLDR üöÄ
Transform Claude Code into an intelligent AI agent orchestration system with automated workflows, specialized agents, and state-aware development pipelines. Just type `_dev`, `_exp`, `_bug`, `_data`, or `_docs` to activate intelligent workflows with automatic agent deployment and quality assurance.

### I'm Listening üëÇ
The 5DXCC Framework is a sophisticated extension for Claude Code that organizes development work into six core operational modes: **Discovery** (_chat), **Development** (_dev), **Documentation** (_docs), **Debugging** (_bug), **Data analysis** (_data), and **eXploration** (_exp). Each mode activates specialized AI agents and automated workflow management. Instead of manually coordinating complex development tasks, the framework automatically detects what you're trying to do and deploys the right combination of expert agents to help you succeed.

**What makes it special:**
- **State-based intelligence**: Different modes (`_dev`, `_exp`, etc.) activate specific workflows and agent teams
- **Autonomous coordination**: Agents automatically collaborate using professional communication protocols
- **Quality assurance**: Built-in supervisor-developer patterns ensure code quality and standards compliance
- **Specialized expertise**: 13 expert agents covering development, debugging, data analysis, exploration, and research

**How it works:**
1. Type a state command (e.g., `_dev`) to activate a development mode
2. The framework automatically detects your task type and complexity
3. Specialized agents are deployed in parallel or sequential workflows
4. Results are integrated and quality-checked before delivery
5. Professional communication protocols ensure smooth agent collaboration

### Technical Talk üîß

The 5DXCC Framework implements a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system through PowerShell automation hooks, JSON-based state management, and specialized agent definitions with domain-specific tool access.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **State Management System**: JSON-persisted state machine with transition detection
- **PowerShell Hook Pipeline**: 11 sequential automation hooks with intelligent behavior control
- **Agent Ecosystem**: 13 specialized agents with defined tools, protocols, and capabilities
- **Workflow Automation**: Task detection and automatic pipeline execution

### State System

| State | Purpose | Tool Access | Available Agents | Automation |

### Workflow Patterns

#### Development Workflow (Supervisor-Developer Pattern)
```
User Request ‚Üí dev-review (strategic planning) ‚Üí dev-dev (implementation) ‚Üí dev-review (QA) ‚Üí User
```

#### Exploration Workflow (Layered Analysis)
```
User Request ‚Üí exp-L0 (60s recon) ‚Üí Multiple exp-L1/L2 (parallel) ‚Üí Consolidated Report
```

#### Debugging Workflow (Systematic Investigation)
```
_understand ‚Üí bug-officer + parallel specialists ‚Üí _debuglog ‚Üí _fix ‚Üí _revert (if needed)
```

#### Data Analysis Workflow (Parallel Optimization)
```
User Request ‚Üí data-flow + data-struct + data-api (parallel) ‚Üí Consolidated Recommendations
```

### PowerShell Hook Pipeline

#### Sequential UserPromptSubmit Chain
1. `help_command_hook.ps1` - Help system integration
2. `no_you_are_right_hook.ps1` - Behavior control (prevents reflexive agreement)
3. `state_management_hook.ps1` - State transition management
4. `dev_pipeline_intelligent_hook.ps1` - Development task auto-detection
5. `data_pipeline_auto_hook.ps1` - Data analysis task automation
6. `exploration_pipeline_hook.ps1` - Exploration workflow automation
7. `debug_pipeline_hook.ps1` - Debug workflow coordination

#### State Management Functions
- **Get-CurrentState**: Retrieve current operational state
- **Set-CurrentState**: Persist state transitions with timestamps
- **Test-BugOfficerAutonomy**: Validate autonomous agent authority
- **Test-ParallelExecutionCompatibility**: Ensure safe parallel agent execution

### Agent Communication Protocol
All agents follow professional courtesy standards:
- Start requests with "Could you please..."
- Use "Thank you for..." when acknowledging work
- Frame complex requests as "I'd appreciate your help with..."
- End with polite closings: "Much appreciated", "Thank you"

### Advanced Features

#### Autonomous Intelligence
- **bug-officer** can autonomously deploy specialist agents based on pattern detection
- **exp-L0** provides intelligent delegation routing based on complexity assessment
- **Parallel execution framework** with intelligent load balancing and conflict prevention

#### Quality Assurance Integration
- Built-in supervisor approval for architectural changes
- Standards compliance checking against CLAUDE.md requirements
- Professional communication protocols for agent collaboration
- Error handling with graceful degradation

#### R/Shiny Ecosystem Specialization
- **safe_execute()** pattern recognition and implementation
- **APP_CONFIG** usage patterns and configuration management
- Reactive programming pattern analysis
- Performance optimization recommendations

## Installation & Integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

**Before adding this framework to an existing project:**

1. **Backup your existing files**: 
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Contains your project-specific instructions
   - `.claude/settings.local.json` - Contains your current Claude Code configuration

2. **Do NOT overwrite existing files**:
   - The `CLAUDE.md` in this repository contains 5DXCC-specific instructions
   - The `settings.local.json` contains hook configurations that may conflict with your setup

3. **Integration approach**:
   - **Option A**: Merge the 5DXCC instructions into your existing `CLAUDE.md`
   - **Option B**: Rename your existing files and use the 5DXCC versions
   - **Option C**: Create a separate development environment for 5DXCC testing

### Integration Steps
1. Copy the `.claude/` directory to your project (excluding files you want to preserve)
2. Merge or replace `CLAUDE.md` with your project-specific requirements
3. Configure `settings.local.json` to include the PowerShell hook chain
4. Test the framework with simple state transitions (`_chat`, `_exp`)
5. Gradually adopt more complex workflows (`_dev`, `_bug`, `_data`)

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and configured
- PowerShell execution environment
- JSON file read/write permissions in the `.claude/` directory

### Verification
Test the installation by typing `_chat` and verifying you receive a state transition message. Then try `_exp` with a simple exploration request to confirm agent coordination is working.
